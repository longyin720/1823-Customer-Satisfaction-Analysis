# 1823-Customer-Satisfaction-Anaysis

## What is 1823?
1823 is a hotline service set up by the Hong Kong government to answer citizens' queries about public services. This mini-project will explore how different factors affecting the public satisfaction score towards 1823 hotline service.

## Scoring System in 1823 Survey Data
The scoring system features 7 items, which are:
  1. Waiting Time
  2. Manner/Attitute

  4. Clear Info

  6. Overall Service
  7. Total Score


All are in a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 as the most satisfactory.

## Discussion
From the graph I created, all items have an average satisfaction score higher than total score except waiting time. This shows training for agents at 1823 call centre is sufficient. Yet, number of agents cannot contain the high call volume of the centre, resulting in significantly lower satisfaction score than other item. This situation worsens during February, May, July, August and December, which are mostly holiday periods (Lunar New Year, Summer Holidays and Christmas). The dips in satisfaction score may reflect increase in usage of public services during holidays so that call volume increases, leading to longer waiting time.
